   abstract = {Mass spectrometry is crucial in proteomics analysis, particularly using Data Independent Acquisition (DIA) for reliable and reproducible mass spectrometry data acquisition, enabling broad mass-to-charge ratio coverage and high throughput. DIA-NN, a prominent deep learning software in DIA proteome analysis, generates peptide results but may include low-confidence peptides. Conventionally, biologists have to manually screen peptide fragment ion chromatogram peaks (XIC) for identifying high-confidence peptides, a time-consuming and subjective process prone to variability. In this study, we introduce SeFilter-DIA, a deep learning algorithm, aiming at automating the identification of high-confidence peptides. Leveraging compressed excitation neural network and residual network models, SeFilter-DIA extracts XIC features and effectively discerns between high and low-confidence peptides. Evaluation of the benchmark datasets demonstrates SeFilter-DIA achieving 99.6% AUC on the test set and 97% for other performance indicators. Furthermore, SeFilter-DIA is applicable for screening peptides with phosphorylation modifications. These results demonstrate the potential of SeFilter-DIA to replace manual screening, providing an efficient and objective approach for high-confidence peptide identification while mitigating associated limitations.},
