        <h3>Abstract</h3>
        <p class="pub-abstract">The newly identified cell death type, pyroptosis plays crucial roles in various
          diseases. Most recently, mounting evidence accumulates that pyroptotic signaling is highly correlated with
          coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Thus, understanding the induction of the pyroptotic signaling and
          dissecting the detail molecular control mechanisms are urgently needed. Based on recent experimental studies,
          a core reg ulatory model of the pyroptotic signaling is constructed to investigate the intricate crosstalk
          dynamics between the two cell death types, i.e., pyroptosis and secondary pyroptosis. The model well
          reproduces the experimental observations under different conditions. Sensitivity analysis determines that only
          the expression level of caspase-1 or GSDMD has the potential to individually change death modes. The de crease
          of caspase-1 or GSDMD level switches cell death from pyroptosis to secondary pyroptosis. Be sides, eight
          biochemical reactions are identified that can efficiently switch death modes. While from the viewpoint of
          bifurcation analysis, the expression level of caspase-3 is further identified and twelve bio chemical
          reactions are obtained. The coexistence of pyroptosis and secondary pyroptosis is predicted to be observed not
          only within the bistable range, but also within proper monostable range, presenting two potential different
          control mechanisms. Combined with the landscape theory, we further explore the stochastic dynamic and global
          stability of the pyroptotic system, accurately quantifying how each compo nent mediates the individual
          occurrence probability of pyroptosis and secondary pyroptosis. Overall, this study sheds new light on the
          intricate crosstalk of the pyroptotic signaling and uncovers the regulatory mechanisms of various stable state
          transitions, providing potential clues to guide the development for prevention and treatment of
          pyroptosis-related diseases</p>
