        <h3>Abstract</h3>
        <p class="pub-abstract">The liberation of calcium ions sequestered in the endoplasmic reticulum through inositol
          1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors/channels (IP(3)Rs) results in a spatiotemporal hierarchy of calcium signaling
          events that range from single-channel openings to local Ca(2+) puffs believed to arise from several to tens of
          clustered IP(3)Rs to global calcium waves. Using high-resolution confocal linescan imaging and a sensitive
          Ca(2+) indicator dye (fluo-4-dextran), we show that puffs are often preceded by small, transient Ca(2+)
          elevations that we christen &ldquo;trigger events&rdquo;. The magnitude of triggers is consistent with their
          arising from the opening of a single IP(3) receptor/channel, and we propose that they initiate puffs by
          recruiting neighboring IP(3)Rs within the cluster by a regenerative process of Ca(2+)-induced Ca(2+) release.
          Puff amplitudes (fluorescence ratio change) are on average approximately 6 times greater than that of the
          triggers, suggesting that at least six IP(3)Rs may simultaneously be open during a puff. Trigger events have
          average durations of approximately 12 ms, as compared to 19 ms for the mean rise time of puffs, and their
          spatial extent is approximately 3 times smaller than puffs (respective widths at half peak amplitude 0.6 and
          1.6 micro m). All these parameters were relatively independent of IP(3) concentration, although the proportion
          of puffs showing resolved triggers was greatest (approximately 80%) at low [IP(3)]. Because Ca(2+) puffs
          constitute the building blocks from which cellular IP(3)-mediated Ca(2+) signals are constructed, the events
          that initiate them are likely to be of fundamental importance for cell signaling. Moreover, the trigger events
          provide a useful yardstick by which to derive information regarding the number and spatial arrangement of
          IP(3)Rs within clusters.</p>
