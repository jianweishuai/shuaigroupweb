abstract: Stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM) is extensively utilized
  in the fields of cell and molecular biology as a super-resolution imaging technique
  for visualizing cells and molecules. Nonetheless, the imaging process of STORM is
  frequently susceptible to noise, which can significantly impact the subsequent image
  analysis. Moreover, there is currently a lack of a comprehensive automated processing
  approach for analyzing protein aggregation states from a large number of STORM images.
  This paper initially applies our previously proposed denoising algorithm, UNet-Att,
  in STORM image denoising. This algorithm was constructed based on attention mechanism
  and multi-scale features, showcasing a remarkably efficient performance in denoising.
  Subsequently, we propose a collection of automated image processing algorithms for
  the ultimate feature extractions and data analyses of the STORM images. The information
  extraction workflow effectively integrates automated methods of image denoising,
  objective image segmentation and binarization, and object information extraction,
  and a novel image information clustering algorithm specifically developed for the
  morphological analysis of the objects in the STORM images. This automated workflow
  significantly improves the efficiency of the effective data analysis for large-scale
  original STORM images.
