abstract: Cirrhosis represents a significant global health challenge, characterized
  by high morbidity and mortality rates that severely impact human health. Timely
  and precise prognostic assessments of liver cirrhosis are crucial for improving
  patient outcomes and reducing mortality rates as they enable physicians to identify
  high-risk patients and implement early interventions. This paper features a thorough
  literature review on the prognostic assessment of liver cirrhosis, aiming to summarize
  and delineate the present status and constraints associated with the application
  of traditional prognostic tools in clinical settings. Among these tools, the Child-Pugh
  and Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) scoring systems are predominantly utilized.
  However, their accuracy varies significantly. These systems are generally suitable
  for broad assessments but lack condition-specific applicability and fail to capture
  the risks associated with dynamic changes in patient conditions. Future research
  in this field is poised for deep exploration into the integration of artificial
  intelligence (AI) with routine clinical and multi-omics data in patients with cirrhosis.
  The goal is to transition from static, unimodal assessment models to dynamic, multimodal
  frameworks. Such advancements will not only improve the precision of prognostic
  tools but also facilitate personalized medicine approaches, potentially revolutionizing
  clinical outcomes.
