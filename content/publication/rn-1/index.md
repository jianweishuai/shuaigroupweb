abstract: Mass spectrometry is crucial in proteomics analysis, particularly using
  Data Independent Acquisition (DIA) for reliable and reproducible mass spectrometry
  data acquisition, enabling broad mass-to-charge ratio coverage and high throughput.
  DIA-NN, a prominent deep learning software in DIA proteome analysis, generates peptide
  results but may include low-confidence peptides. Conventionally, biologists have
  to manually screen peptide fragment ion chromatogram peaks (XIC) for identifying
  high-confidence peptides, a time-consuming and subjective process prone to variability.
  In this study, we introduce SeFilter-DIA, a deep learning algorithm, aiming at automating
  the identification of high-confidence peptides. Leveraging compressed excitation
  neural network and residual network models, SeFilter-DIA extracts XIC features and
  effectively discerns between high and low-confidence peptides. Evaluation of the
  benchmark datasets demonstrates SeFilter-DIA achieving 99.6% AUC on the test set
  and 97% for other performance indicators. Furthermore, SeFilter-DIA is applicable
  for screening peptides with phosphorylation modifications. These results demonstrate
  the potential of SeFilter-DIA to replace manual screening, providing an efficient
  and objective approach for high-confidence peptide identification while mitigating
  associated limitations.
