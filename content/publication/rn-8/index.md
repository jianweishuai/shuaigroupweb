abstract: Aging is a complex and heterogeneous biological process at cellular, tissue,
  and individual levels. Despite extensive effort in scientific research, a comprehensive
  understanding of aging mechanisms remains lacking. This study analyzed aging-related
  gene networks, using single-cell RNA sequencing data from >15 000 cells. We constructed
  a gene correlation network, integrating gene expressions into the weights of network
  edges, and ranked gene importance using a random walk model to generate a gene importance
  matrix. This unsupervised method improved the clustering performance of cell types.
  To further quantify the complexity of gene networks during aging, we introduced
  network structural entropy. The findings of our study reveal that the overall network
  structural entropy increases in the aged cells compared to the young cells. However,
  network entropy changes varied greatly within different cell subtypes. Specifically,
  the network structural entropy among various cell types may increase, remain unchanged,
  or decrease. This wide range of changes may be closely related to their individual
  functions, highlighting the cellular heterogeneity and potential key network reconfigurations.
  Analyzing gene network entropy provides insights into the molecular mechanisms behind
  aging. This study offers new scientific evidence and theoretical support for understanding
  the changes in cell functions during aging.
