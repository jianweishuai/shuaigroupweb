abstract: Maximizing materials utilization efficiency via enhancing their reconfigurability
  and multifunctionality offers a promising avenue in addressing the global challenges
  in sustainability. To this end, significant efforts have been made in developing
  reconfigurable multifunctional smart materials, which can exhibit remarkable behaviors
  such as morphing and self-healing. However, the difficulty in efficiently manipulating
  and controlling matter at the building block level with manageable cost and complexity,
  which is crucial to achieving superior responsiveness to environmental clues and
  stimuli, has significantly hindered the further development of such smart materials.
  Here we introduce a concept of Robo-Matter, which can be activated and controlled
  through external information exchange at the building block level, to enable a high-level
  of controllability, mutability and versatility for reconfigurable multifunctional
  smart materials. Using specially designed micro-robot building blocks with symmetry-breaking
  active motion modes, tunable anisotropic interactions, and interactive coupling
  with a programmable spatial-temporal dynamic light field, we demonstrate an emergent
  Robot-Matter duality, which enables a spectrum of desirable behaviors spanning from
  matter-like properties such as ultra-fast self-assembly and adaptivity, to robot-like
  properties including active force output, smart healing, smart morphing and infiltration.
  Our work demonstrates a promising direction for designing next-generation smart
  materials and large-scale robotic swarms.
