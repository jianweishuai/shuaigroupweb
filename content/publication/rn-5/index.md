abstract: 'INTRODUCTION: With the escalating menace of organic compounds in environmental
  pollution imperiling the survival of aquatic organisms, the investigation of organic
  compound toxicity across diverse aquatic species assumes paramount significance
  for environmental protection. Understanding how different species respond to these
  compounds helps assess the potential ecological impact of pollution on aquatic ecosystems
  as a whole. Compared with traditional experimental methods, deep learning methods
  have higher accuracy in predicting aquatic toxicity, faster data processing speed
  and better generalization ability. OBJECTIVES: This article presents ATFPGT-multi,
  an advanced multi-task deep neural network prediction model for organic toxicity.
  METHODS: The model integrates molecular fingerprints and molecule graphs to characterize
  molecules, enabling the simultaneous prediction of acute toxicity for the same organic
  compound across four distinct fish species. Furthermore, to validate the advantages
  of multi-task learning, we independently construct prediction models, named ATFPGT-single,
  for each fish species. We employ cross-validation in our experiments to assess the
  performance and generalization ability of ATFPGT-multi. RESULTS: The experimental
  results indicate, first, that ATFPGT-multi outperforms ATFPGT-single on four fish
  datasets with AUC improvements of 9.8%, 4%, 4.8%, and 8.2%, respectively, demonstrating
  the superiority of multi-task learning over single-task learning. Furthermore, in
  comparison with previous algorithms, ATFPGT-multi outperforms comparative methods,
  emphasizing that our approach exhibits higher accuracy and reliability in predicting
  aquatic toxicity. Moreover, ATFPGT-multi utilizes attention scores to identify molecular
  fragments associated with fish toxicity in organic molecules, as demonstrated by
  two organic molecule examples in the main text, demonstrating the interpretability
  of ATFPGT-multi. CONCLUSION: In summary, ATFPGT-multi provides important support
  and reference for the further development of aquatic toxicity assessment. All of
